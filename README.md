Wouldn't it be nice to have one place to manage and display your analog film assets? I shoot analog film and my hybrid analog-digital workflow is all over the place. Sites for sharing (who owns that image now?), other sites for tech discussion, still more sites for professional development, portfolios and, of course, another process for embedding and managing exif data. I just want to scan and store my assets and have the exif data automagically update everywhere. Oh, and only through a secure private cloud.

## Requires:

* Exiftool
* Exiftool_php
* Topcolors
* Drupal7

## Hybrid Workflow Example:

EXIF_STUDIO
           
           -PROJECT_ONE
                       \
                        1-GEAR
                        2-GRADE
                        3-CROP
                        4-RETOUCH
                        5-FOLIO

           -PROJECT_TWO
                       \
                        1-GEAR
                        2-GRADE
                        3-CROP
                        4-RETOUCH
                        5-FOLIO   
                        
You simply move assets along the path in your private local workspace and exif data is automagically added. Your exif data and workflow is managed online and your media assets are managed locally. Changes made online are propigated locally in simple folder structures. Whatever you put in your FOLIO is available online for sharing, publication or sale. Permissions are flexible and easy to manage. Licenses are managed online in exif data. FOLIO space can be fully branded with your own domain name based on subscription level.

My hope is that what works for me also works for you to support the demands of analog media.

Exif Studio has significant costs and I refuse to place ads for revenue. Membership is offered by subscription only. I am not interested kickstarter type fundraising. To join as an early adopter and beta tester, please call or txt. - Kelley Graham
